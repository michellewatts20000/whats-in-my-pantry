# What's in my pantry

## The app functionality

This is an app that will display recipes based on a list of food items that are currently in your pantry ready to use. The app will allow you to check against any allergies. A fun fact will also be presented at the bottom of the recipe.

## Daily problem to solve using a persona example

TRISHA is a single mum and wants to make dinner for her kids but is time poor and doesn't want to go to the shops
TRISHA checks the kitchen cupboards and types what she has in the cupboard into the app
The app produces recipe's she can make with those ingredients
TRISHA also needs to check for allergies as her children have nut and lactose allergies
The app will only display recipes that use those ingredients and rules out any with corresponding allergies
TRISHA also likes this app as she wants to entertain the kids and knows that the recipes also include a fun fact at the bottom of the recipe she can share with the kids
