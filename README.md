# What's in my pantry

## The app functionality

This is an app that will display recipes based on a list of food items that are currently in your pantry ready to use. The app will allow you to check against any allergies and dietary requirements. A fun fact will also be presented at the bottom of the recipe to keep your group entertained.

## Daily problem to solve using a persona example

TRENT is a single parent and wants to make dinner for his kids but is time poor and doesn't want to go to the shops<br>
TRENT checks the kitchen cupboards and types what he has in the cupboard into the app<br>
The app produces recipe's he can make with those ingredients<br>
TRENT also needs to check for allergies as his children have nut and lactose allergies<br>
The app will only display recipes that use those ingredients and rules out any with corresponding allergies<br>
TRENT also likes this app as he wants to entertain the kids and knows that the recipes also include a fun fact at the bottom of the recipe he can share with the kids
