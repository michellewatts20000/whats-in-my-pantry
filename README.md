WHAT'S IN MY PANTRY is an easy to use, all-in-one recipe search app that will display recipes based on a list of food items that are currently in your pantry<br>
THIS APP will allow you to check against a set list of allergies and dietary requirements<br>
AS A BONUS the app will present you with a fun cat fact to keep you and your guests entertained while cooking<br>

## Daily problem to solve using a persona example

TRENT is a single parent and wants to make dinner for his kids but is time poor and doesn’t want to go to the shops<br>
TRENT checks the kitchen cupboards and types what he has in the cupboard into the app<br>
The app produces recipe’s he can make with those  ingredients<br>
TRENT also needs to check for allergies as his kid has peanut allergy<br>
The app will only display recipes that don’t contain peanuts<br>
TRENT also likes this app as he wants to entertain the kids and knows that the recipes also includes a fun fact that will pop up on the screen<br>
